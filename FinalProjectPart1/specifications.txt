Final Project
Part 1

You will design a program that manages the inventory of an electronics store. You will need to use a
number of concepts that you learned in class including: use of classes, use of dictionaries and input and
output of comma delimeted csv files.
Input:

a) ManufacturerList.csv -- contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID,
manufacturer name, item type, and optionally a damaged indicator

b) PriceList.csv -- contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID and the item price.

c) ServiceDatesList.csv – contains items listed by row. Each row contains item ID and service
date.

Example ManufacturerList.csv, PriceList.csv and ServiceDatesList.csv are provided for reference. Your
code will be expected to work with any group input files of the appropriate format. Manufacturers can
and will likely be different as will the actual items.

Required Output:

Processed Inventory Reports:

a. FullInventory.csv -- all the items listed by row with all their information . The items
should be sorted alphabetically by manufacturer. Each row should contain item ID,
manufacturer name, item type, price, service date, and list if it is damaged. The item
attributes must appear in this order.

b. Item type Inventory list, i.e LaptopInventory.csv -- there should be a file for each item
type and the item type needs to be in the file name. Each row of the file should contain
item ID, manufacturer name, price, service date, and list if it is damaged. The items
should be sorted by their item ID.

c. PastServiceDateInventory.csv – all the items that are past the service date on the day
the program is actually executed. Each row should contain: item ID, manufacturer
name, item type, price, service date, and list if it is damaged. The items must appear in
the order of service date from oldest to most recent.

d. DamagedInventory.csv –all items that are damaged. Each row should contain : item ID,
manufacturer name, item type, price, and service date. The items must appear in the
order of most expensive to least expensive. 

Commit all your .py files on Github. Provide a link on BlackBoard. Put all your files in a folder named
“FinalProjectPart1” and name your files with the starting phrase “FinalProject” for example
FinalProjectInput.py

Comment your code extensively. Include comment block with your name and student ID at the top of
every .py file.
